                This was a design for someone who's been making custom game case
                artwork for some time and wanted to try displaying Nintendo
                Switch game cartridges in audio cassette cases with custom
                printed J-cards. Getting all the details just right took many
                iterations. Other people's designs for cartridge holders are
                usually friction fit and will damage the cartridges over time,
                so we wanted something spring loaded like the official Nintendo
                cases. Designing an integral mechanism that could be 3D printed
                in place took trial and error. Tuning the overall shape to fit
                nicely into the cassette cases while still looking aesthetically
                pleasing and being reliably printable also took patience. In the
                end, these are very friendly to 3D printing, look great, and the
                person making the cassette cases has sold quite a few with my
                prints!
