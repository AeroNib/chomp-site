# Chomp Workshop Project Site

This site is a visual catalog of various personal creative projects I've worked on.

## Editing and Building the Site

This is a static site built with HTML and CSS and minimal JavaScript to accomplish some things like serving dynamic navigation links. The site structure is simple and designed around reuse.

To add new projects, create a new folder — the recommended naming is `YYYYnn` where `nn` is a sequencial number, e.g., `202601`, `202602`, etc. This is to help keep projects roughly in chronological order. Copy an `index.html` from another project and edit the project name, year, text, and Thangs link. The text and Thangs link are optional and be commented out if not applicable.

A local clone of the repository can be tested by running the `./serve.sh` script to start a Python web server.
