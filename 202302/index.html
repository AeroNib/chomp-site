                When I moved to new house with a new and very empty basement
                begging to transform into a workshop, I was inspired by Adam
                Savage's tool cart. His philosophy on the first order of
                retrievability means that the tools you use most often should be
                visible and at hand. I've never been a fan of stashing
                everything away in cabinets and drawers where they go to die.
                Having designed, built, and used this cart for a few years now,
                it feels like some kind of cheat code.
