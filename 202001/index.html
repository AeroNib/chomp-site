                This was an experiment to design and build a custom Nixie clock
                with as much of my own PCB as possible. It was a learning
                experience in high voltage circuitry design and in soldering
                some of the highest density IC packages up to that point. The
                clock was designed around Soviet IN-12A and IN-2 tubes that I
                installed into thru-hole sockets. My code ran on an Arduino
                development board, and it controlled the high voltage tube
                inputs using a series of HV5530 shift registers with clamped
                outputs. While the clock worked perfectly, the Taylor 1363
                high-voltage power supply flyback boost converter emitted a
                headache-inducing audible whine. If I revisit ths project, I
                would try a different power supply or design my own. While I was
                planning to use a bare ATmega chip on the final board instead of
                the Arduino dev board, I would instead switch to an ESP32 module
                that is much more flexible and includes integrated WiFi for
                network time sync.
